Athena: <i>Melissa Miss Peacock. Never thought I'd get to meet her in person.</i>#s:Peacock#el:Surprised
Athena: <i>I've been listening to her music since the beginning of her career.</i>
Athena: <i>Oh my gosh and her new single, “Birds of a Feather”, is soooo good.</i>#el:Happy
Athena: Good morning Miss Peacock.#el:Neutral
Melissa: Hello darling. Quite an unfortunate morning, is it not?
Athena: Quite. I'm actually here to speak with you about this.#el:Intense
Melissa: Oh?
Athena: I'm a detective. Detective Nox. I may have a few questions for you about this.#el:Neutral
Melissa: Oh my, am I a suspect?
Athena: Not at the moment, you're not. But there's something fishy about this scene, and I'd like some help to get to the bottom of this.
Melissa: I see.

Melissa: Now, what would you like to ask?#el:Neutral
-> Where were you last night?
	Melissa: My, let's see. 
	Melissa: I recall drinking with Morgana around last night.
	Melissa: She was such a darling and made me my favorite cocktail.
	Athena: What did you two drink?
	Melissa: She made me a Blue Lagoon, but I don't believe she actually had any alcohol.
	Athena: ...#el:Sad
	Melissa: We chatted for a while until I went off to bed. I don't remember exactly when, but I remember I woke up in the morning around 7:55 with a nasty hangover.#el:Neutral
	<<jump PeacockQuestions1>>
-> What are your thoughts about Mallard?
	Melissa: He. Ugh. You see..
	Athena: It's ok. Take your time.
	Melissa: He and I used to get along fine, at least until I knew he was a swindler.
	Athena: Swindler?#el:Intense
	Melissa: ...#el:Neutral
	<<jump PeacockQuestions0>>
-> Do you know if anyone would want to kill him?
	Melissa: My.. well I've overheard Mr. Gander was having troubles with Mallard.
	Melissa: I don't know much, but I believe it has something to do with Gander's disdain for Mallard's business practices.
	Melissa: I hear he blames Mallard for the current state of his company...
	Melissa: I don't blame him to be honest.
	Melissa: Mallard has a way with <color=\#f3db82>spending more than he has...</color>
	Athena: What of the other passengers?
	Melissa: Well the bellboy has always given me strange vibes. There's just something.. off about him.
	Athena: That's hardly evidence.
	Melissa: I suppose not.
	Melissa: ...
	Melissa: As for Morgana, given that you're still alive, I doubt it was her.
	Athena: What do you mean?
	Melissa: *laugh* <color=\#f3db82>Well she used to be in love with that duck.</color> If she were the ex killing type, I think you'd be the first she'd kill.
	Athena: She.. what?#el:Surprised
	<<CreateClue ClueBoardCanvas CrowEx>>
	: Got Evidence <color=\#94e9e4>Morgana's Ex</color>
	Melissa: Oh dear, did you not know?
	Athena: ... #el:Sad
	Athena: Let's just move on.#el:Neutral
	Melissa: Alright..
	<<jump PeacockQuestions0>>
-> I heard you and Mallard had an argument. <<if $PeacockArgument>>
	Melissa: Yes we had an argument. 
	Melissa: It was about the money he owed me.
	Melissa: I was upset that he somehow was unable to pay me despite that fortune he boasts about.
	Melissa: That extravagant duck was <color=\#f3db82>broke this entire time</color>...
	Melissa: I was angry in the moment, but I swear I would never actually hurt someone over this.
	Athena: People don't always kill for rational reasons.#el:Intense
	Melissa: ...
	Athena: How did you learn of lack of funds? I hear he kept up his appearances well.#el:Neutral
	Melissa: ...
	Melissa: I've said too much.
	Athena: <i>Perhaps I should ask <color=\#f3db82>someone who worked closely</color> with Mallard about this...</i>

Melissa: Is there anything else, dear?#el:Neutral
	-> Did you hear anything in the morning?
		Melissa: I don't recall. No.
		<<jump PeacockQuestions1>>
	-> What did you do after waking up?
		Melissa: I looked around my room for 10 minutes for antacid. When I couldn't find one, I left to ask Morgana for one.
		Melissa: To my surprise I found her in front of the parlor door. 
		Melissa: I asked about entering the parlor, but the poor thing said she lost her keys in her room. I admit I may have been a bit loud. I think I woke up Mr. Gander.
		Athena: I see. What happened after?
		Melissa: When Morgana got back, she unlocked the car door.. and..
		Melissa: That was when..
		Athena: ... you saw it.#el:Sad
		Melissa: ...
		Melissa: anyways..#el:Neutral

	Melissa: Oh! Oh Gander!
	Athena: Was it true he was with you last night?
	Melissa: Yes, now that I think about it.
	Melissa: My memory is a little hazy, but <color=\#f3db82>he was with me for quite a while last night</color>.
	Melissa: Oh Gander... what should I say?

Athena: I noticed your name on this note. Do you know why Mallard would address you in a note such as this?#el:Neutral
Melissa: He did <color=\#f3db82>owe me a large sum of money</color>.
Athena: Do you know why someone may burn the note?
Melissa: ...
Athena: Do you have an idea of what the rest of the note may contain?
Melissa: He was a <color=\#f3db82>gambling addict</color>.
Athena: Gambling addict?#el:Intense
Melissa: Could I see the note, perhaps?
Athena: Sure.#el:Neutral
Melissa: ...
Melissa: My, is this a suicide note?
Athena: It would appear so.
Athena: At least <i>appears</i> so.
Athena: We've already proven this was not in fact a suicide, so <color=\#f3db82>it's very possible the murderer planted it as fake evidence</color>.
Athena: The only question is though, <color=\#f3db82>why would it be burned</color>?#el:Intense
Melissa: And how did they know about me and Mallard's-
Melissa: Nevermind.#el:Neutral

    Melissa: ...
    Melissa: <color=\#f3db82>Yeah that was also from me</color>, but I can explain.
    Melissa: I smuggled some on the train, not to sell. 
    Melissa: <color=\#f3db82>I went to my bag last night to grab some</color>, just because I was stressed.
    Melissa: The slimy duck caught me smoking it, and threatened to report me if I didn't give him one.
    Melissa: I wanted to punch the living daylights out of him, but I resisted.
    Melissa: I gave him the reed and told him <color=\#f3db82>I didn't want to move Gander's heavy suitcase again</color>.

Athena: With Morgana?
Melissa: Yes, dear.
Athena: ...#el:Neutral
Melissa: You know, the dear talks about you quite a lot.
Melissa: She used to go out with that duck, yes, but she clearly never felt the same about him as she did for you.
Melissa: He was clearly a bounce back relationship.
Melissa: Anyways...
