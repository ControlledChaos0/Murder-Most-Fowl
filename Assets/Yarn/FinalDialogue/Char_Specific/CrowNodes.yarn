        Athena: It's ok. You can tell me.
        Morgana: Just, you believe I didn't do it, right?#e:Neutral
        Athena: Of course.
        Morgana: Well I was at the bar last night, as usual.
        Morgana: Mallard came up an ordered a drink from me.
        Morgana: He started <color=\#f3db82>complaining about Mr. Gander</color> of all people.
        Morgana: If I'm being honest, I tuned most of it out.
        Morgana: I didn't care much for his complaining.#e:Angry
        Morgana: Anyways...#e:Neutral
        Morgana: He soon stepped away to smoke a cigarette.
        Morgana: Melissa came in, and told Mallard to cluck off.
        Morgana: Mallard made a weird face though... <color=\#f3db82>as if he figured something out.</color>#e:Sad
        Morgana: Melissa sat down with me, and Mallard made some distance. #e:Neutral
        Morgana: Skipper soon came in for his break and began chatting with Mallard.
        Morgana: I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I saw <color=\#f3db82>Mallard take Skipper's coat</color> for him.
        Morgana: He walked past the bar to leave the room, and I overheard him mumbling...
        Morgana: <color=\#f3db82>"Mark my words. This is the day I get even."</color>
        Morgana: Shortly after Melissa and I left to go to sleep, I heard Gander in the hall.
        Morgana: I think he was <color=\#f3db82>headed to Melissa's room</color>.
        Morgana: I...#e:Sad
        Morgana: I'm sorry.
        Morgana: I should have told you sooner.
        Athena: It's alright. I understand.
        Morgana: ...
        Athena: Is that all to your testimony?
