Athena:<i> This is that bellboy that stopped me earlier. He looks so nervous…</i>
Athena: <i>Makes sense. If I worked here, I would be nervous too.</i>
Athena: <i>Poor kid.</i>

Skipper: Is there any way I can help?#e:Happy#s:Penguin
-> Where were you last night?
	Skipper: Hmm.. Well I spent a lot of time searching for my keys last night.#e:Neutral
	Athena: Your keys? What happened to them?
	Skipper: I believe I misplaced them. Though...
	Skipper: ...#e:Sad
	Skipper: Now that I think about it.. <color=\#f3db82>that eve Mallard offered to hang my coat up for me.</color>#e:Neutral
	Skipper: I didn't think much of it at the time, but I believe my keys went missing around that time.
	Athena: Did you ever find your keys?
	Skipper: I did not, so I asked Morgana to lock up the parlor.#e:Sad
	Athena: Did you notice anything else last night?
	Skipper: <color=\#f3db82>I heard a crash in the middle of the night</color>, but I did not have the energy to deal with it.#e:Neutral
	Skipper: I swear I tied all the luggage down properly.
	Skipper: Though... I could've missed something when <color=\#f3db82>Melissa came to get something from her luggage</color>.
	Athena: What about the morning? 
	Skipper: I woke to the sound of chatter outside.
	Skipper: I hadn't slept well so I was pretty groggy.
	Skipper: When Morgana unlocked the parlor door in the morning and the body was found, I took charge of the situation.
	Skipper: It's my job to ensure the safety of this train, which is why I wanted to handle it.
	<<jump PenguinConversation>>
-> What are your thoughts about Mallard?
	Skipper: ...#e:Neutral
	Skipper: Honestly I don't like him.#e:Sad
	Skipper: He's quite rude and snobbish.
	Skipper: He came from great wealth, so he probably grew up with everything going his way.#e:Neutral
	Skipper: However.. I feel like there was something off about him.
	Athena: Have you interacted with him much?
	Skipper: Thankfully I haven't had to deal with him much when I worked with Mr. Gander.
	Athena: What do you know about Mallard and Gander?
	Skipper: I know they started the company together, but if you want to know more, Mr. Gander would be the one to ask.
	: Got Evidence <color=\#94e9e4>Gander's Business Partner</color>
	<<CreateClue ClueBoardCanvas GooseBusinessPartner>>
	<<jump PenguinConversation>>
-> Do you know if anyone would want to kill him?#e:Neutral
	Skipper: Oh he knew how to make enemies.
	Skipper: In fact I believe he's involved with everyone in this car in some way.
	Skipper: I can tell you about whoever you wish.
	<<jump PenguinEnemies>>
-> <color=\#94e9e4>Present</color>
	<<PresentEvidence>>
-> Not now
	Athena: Thank you for your help. I'll be back later.
	Skipper: Glad to help!#e:Happy
	Skipper: If you need anything, I'll be in the luggage room.#e:Neutral

Athena: Tell me about...
-> Chase Gander
	Skipper: Ah, Gander.#e:Neutral
	Skipper: Mallard definitely.. left on bad terms with him.#e:Sad
	Skipper: I'm not sure exactly why, but Mr. Gander had told that duck <color=\#f3db82>he needs to find a new job</color>.
	Skipper: Kicked the poor guy off to the streets.
	Skipper: Would you like to know about anyone else?#e:Neutral
	<<jump PenguinEnemies>>
-> Melissa Peacock
	Skipper: Melissa comes across as the most suspicious to me.#e:Neutral
	Athena: Oh?#el:Surprised
	Skipper: I overheard those two having a quite.. extreme argument the other day.#e:Sad
	Skipper: I couldn't make out a lot of what they were saying, but what I did overhear was concerning to say the least.
	Athena: What did you hear?#el:Neutral
	Skipper: I heard phrases such as <color=\#f3db82>"...RUINING PEOPLE'S LIVES"..</color>#e:Neutral
	Skipper: and <color=\#f3db82>"...MONEY OR YOU'RE CLUCKING DEAD"</color>.
	Athena: Coming from Melissa? I find that kind of hard to believe.#el:Intense
	Skipper: It's hard for me to believe too, but I remember what I heard.
	Athena: Perhaps I should <color=\#f3db82>ask Melissa</color> about this...
	<<set $PeacockArgument to true>>
	Skipper: Would you like to know about anyone else?#el:Neutral
	<<jump PenguinEnemies>>
-> Morgana Noir
	Skipper: Well Mallard would complain to me about her messing up his drinks constantly.#e:Neutral
	Skipper: Morgana is a good bartender. If she messed up his drink that many times it must've been out of spite.
	Skipper: Would you like to know about anyone else?
	<<jump PenguinEnemies>>
-> You.
	Skipper: Me?#e:Neutral
	Skipper: I mean I knew him. 
	Skipper: We were never really close.
	Skipper: ...#e:Sad
	Skipper: Would you like to know about anyone else?
	<<jump PenguinEnemies>>
-> That's all.
	Athena: That's all the questions about connections I have for now.
	Skipper: Alright!#e:Happy

Athena: This stool is way too short for the duck to have reached the chandelier himself.

Athena: He was certainly hung. The suffocation is clear.

Skipper: Be sure to <color=\#f3db82>question everyone thoroughly</color>.
Skipper: If you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer.
