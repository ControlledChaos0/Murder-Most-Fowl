Athena: *cough cough* Ugh I can't sleep.
Athena: The Bird Flu is no joke...#el:Sad
???: CRASH
Athena: ... what was that?#el:Surprised
???: clop clop clop
Athena: Who's up this late at night making such a ruckus.#el:Intense
Athena: Luckily *cough* for them I'm too sick to do anything about it.#el:Sad
Athena: I'm already up. Perhaps I'll just read a book for a bit.

Singsongy Woman: What's going on? Why's the door locked?
Disgruntled Man: Isn't the parlor supposed to be open by now?
Tired Woman: I'm sorry, I'll get that unlocked for you.
Athena: The early birds are up bright and early...#el:Neutral
Athena: Unfortunately I am too...#el:Sad
<<ChangeLeftCharacter>>
Tired Woman: Alright you should be able to get in now.
Tired Woman: I apologize for the inconvenience.
Athena: Great. Now I can get back to slee-
Singsongy Woman: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Disgruntled Man: Oh dear heavens.
Nervous Boy: What on earth?
Athena: What's that all about?#el:Surprised
Athena: I should check this out.#el:Neutral
Athena: Oh dear Phoenix. How did this happen?#el:Surprised
Athena: I suppose that's up to me to figure out.#el:Intense
Skipper: Excuse me ma'am, but I can't let you disturb the scene. I'm about to phone the police.#e:Angry
Athena: Yes, yes, I understand, but conveniently I'm a detective.#el:Neutral
Skipper: A detective? But what needs investigating? The poor duck clearly hung himself.#e:Sad
Skipper: I don't want to mess with the scene until the police arrive.
Athena: Say, bellboy, if I can prove to you this “suicide” was in fact a murder, will you let me investigate further?
Skipper: I suppose… If this was a murder it would help to have a detective on the case.#e:Neutral
Athena: It's a deal.
Athena: Before I begin. Could I ask, what is the victim's name?
Skipper: Mallard. <color=\#f3db82>Seaton Mallard.</color>
Athena: Thank you. I ensure you I'll get to the bottom of this.
<<ChangeRightCharacter>>
Athena: ...#el:Intense
Athena: The murder must've transpired last night.#e:Neutral
Athena: Now that I think about it <color=\#f3db82>I did hear a lot of weird noises</color> while reading my book last night...
Athena: Let's see.#el:Intense
Athena: First, I heard <color=\#f3db82>muffled talking</color> outside my room followed by <color=\#f3db82>two doors opening and closing.</color>#el:Neutral
Athena: I then heard <color=\#f3db82>another set of doors open and close.</color>
Athena: I can only assume these were bedroom doors...
Athena: I heard <color=\#f3db82>another room door open</color> just as <color=\#f3db82>the parlor door and luggage doors were open and shut.</color>
Athena: Must've been the parlor door and luggage car doors as they're both sliding doors.
Athena: Then there was a <color=\#f3db82>loud crash</color> before <color=\#f3db82>another room door opened</color> and the <color=\#f3db82>main parlor door was opened and shut</color>.
Athena: I heard <color=\#f3db82>another room door open and shut</color> followed by a <color=\#f3db82>thump</color> before hearing <color=\#f3db82>a room door open and shut.</color>
Athena: Finally, <color=\#f3db82>the parlor door was open and shut one more time</color>...
Athena: This alone is not much to go off of. 
Athena: I should <color=\#f3db82>find clues</color> and <color=\#f3db82>question the passengers</color> before I present my proof.
