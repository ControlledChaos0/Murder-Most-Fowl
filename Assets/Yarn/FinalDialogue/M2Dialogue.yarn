Athena: An investigation? On my vacation?
Athena: Can't an overworked owl get any time to relax around here?
Athena: …
Athena: I suppose what's done is done. This scene needs investigating.
Skipper: Excuse me ma'am, but I can't let you disturb the scene. I'm about to phone the police.
Athena: Yes, yes, I understand, but conveniently I'm a detective.
Skipper: A detective? But what needs investigating? The poor duck clearly hung himself. 
Skipper: I don't want to mess with the scene until the police arrive.
Athena: Say, bellboy, if I can prove to you this “suicide” was in fact a murder, will you let me investigate further?
Skipper: I suppose… If this was a murder it couldn't help to have a detective on the case.
Athena: It's a deal.

Athena: This is that bellboy that stopped me earlier. He looks so nervous…
Athena: Makes sense. If I worked here, I would be nervous too.
Athena: Poor kid.

Athena: I'm almost too intimidated to talk to him.
Athena: Good Morning, Mr. Gander.
Chase: Who am I speaking to?
Athena: I'm Detective Athena Nox.
Chase: I assure you there's not much more than what meets the eye.
Chase: This scenario is… unfortunate but not entirely unexpected.
Athena: I'm sure there's something you could help me with to shed light on the situation.

Athena: Good morning Miss Peacock.

Melissa: Hello darling. Quite an unfortunate morning, is it not?
Athena: Quite. I'm actually here to speak with you about this.
Melissa: Oh?
Athena: I'm a detective. Detective Nox. I may have a few questions for you about this.
Melissa: Oh dear, am I a suspect?
Athena: Not at the moment, you're not. But there's something fishy about this scene, and I'd like some help to get to the bottom of this.
